# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains two computer vision projects: Face Detection and Hand Tracking. These projects leverage various computer vision techniques and libraries to accomplish their respective tasks. Below, you'll find an overview of each project.

## Face Detection

The Face Detection project focuses on detecting and locating human faces in images and video streams. It utilizes the power of deep learning algorithms and the OpenCV library to accurately identify faces within a given frame. The project includes pre-trained models and code to perform real-time face detection, making it applicable for a wide range of applications, including facial recognition, emotion detection, and augmented reality.

Features of the Face Detection project:
- Real-time face detection in images and video streams
- Face landmark detection to identify key facial features
- Ability to draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Integration with OpenCV for image and video processing

## Hand Tracking

The Hand Tracking project aims to track and recognize human hand gestures in real-time. It employs computer vision techniques, including image segmentation and tracking algorithms, to detect and track the movements of hands in video input. By accurately capturing hand gestures, this project enables the development of intuitive and interactive interfaces for applications such as sign language recognition, virtual reality interactions, and touchless control systems.

Features of the Hand Tracking project:
- Real-time hand detection and tracking in video streams
- Hand landmark estimation for precise tracking of hand movements
- Gesture recognition to identify common hand poses and gestures
- Integration with OpenCV and MediaPipe frameworks
